                To implement a tab component in Next.js using MUI (Material-UI), similar to the code you provided, but with tabs labeled "Description," "Vendor Info," and "Review," you can follow the steps below. This will give a functional and accessible tab component within your Next.js application.

                First, make sure you have MUI installed in your project:

                sh

            .</p>
        </Box>
    );
}
